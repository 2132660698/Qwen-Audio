**Qwen-Audio** (Qwen Large Audio Language Model) is the multimodal version of the large model series, Qwen (abbr. Tongyi Qianwen), proposed by Alibaba Cloud. Qwen-Audio accepts diverse audio (human speech, natural sound, music and song) and text as inputs, outputs text. The contribution of Qwen-Audio include:

- **Fundamental audio models**: We introduce Qwen-Audio, a fundamental multi-task audio-language model that supports various tasks, languages, and audio types, serving as a universal audio understanding model. Building upon Qwen-Audio, we develop Qwen-Audio-Chat through instruction fine-tuning, enabling multi-turn dialogues and supporting diverse audio-oriented scenarios. Both Qwen-Audio and Qwen-Audio-Chat models are open-source, promoting the growth and development of the audio-text multimodal community.
- **Multi-task learning framework for all types of audios**: To scale up audio-language pre-training, we address the challenge of variation in textual labels associated with different datasets by proposing a multi-task training framework, enabling knowledge sharing and avoiding one-to-many interference. Our model incorporates more than 30 tasks and extensive experiments show the model achieves strong performance.
- **Strong Performance**: Experimental results show that Qwen-Audio achieves impressive performance across diverse benchmark tasks without requiring any task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing its counterparts. Specifically, Qwen-Audio achieves state-of-the-art results on the test set of Aishell1, cochlscene, ClothoAQA, and VocalSound.
- **Flexible multi-run chat from audio and text input**: Qwen-Audio supports multiple-audio analysis, sound understading and reasoning, music appreciation, and tool usage for speech editing.

We are going to release two models of the Qwen-VL series soon:

- Qwen-Audio: The pre-trained multi-task audio understanding model uses Qwen-7B as the initialization of the LLM, and [Whisper-large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper) as the initialization of the audio encoder.
- Qwen-Audio-Chat: A multimodal LLM-based AI assistant, which is trained with alignment techniques. Qwen-Audio-Chat supports more flexible interaction, such as multiple audio inputs, multi-round question answering, and creative capabilities.
